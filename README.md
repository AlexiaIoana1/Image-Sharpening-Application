# ImageSharp â€“  Java Image Enhancement Tool

## Description

Get ready to take your images to the next level with ImageSharp! This Java-based image processing tool focuses on sharpening techniques to bring out those hidden details and transform your photos from ordinary to extraordinary.

## Core Features

- **Powerful Sharpening Algorithms:** ImageSharp harnesses the power of image sharpening algorithms to intelligently accentuate edges and features within your images.
    
- **Optimized for Performance:** Experience speedy image transformations thanks to the multi-threaded design at the heart of ImageSharp. Now you can process even large image files without the frustrating wait.
    
- **Customization Potential:** While ImageSharp uses a standard 3x3 convolution mask, explore how changing those values in the code can affect the results.
    
- **User-Friendly Experience:** Whether you're a command-line pro or prefer a guided experience, ImageSharp adapts to you. It accepts image file paths via command-line arguments or through an interactive input method.
    

## How to Use ImageSharp

1. **Get the Code:** [Instructions on how to obtain the source code (download, clone from a repository, etc.)]
2. **Compilation:** [Step-by-step guide on compiling the Java code.]
3. **Sharpen Your Images:**
    
    - **Command line:**
        
        ```
        java ImageSharp input_image.jpg output_image.jpg 
        ```
        
    - **Interactive Mode:** [Instructions if you built in an interactive input prompt]
    

## Behind the Scenes

- **The Magic of Convolution:** ImageSharp applies convolution masks, small matrices used to modify pixel values based on their neighbors. Learn more about this fundamental image processing technique! [Optional: Include a link to a resource explaining convolution]
    
- **Multithreading in Action:** ImageSharp leverages multiple threads to simultaneously load, process, and save image data. See if you can spot the performance difference compared to a single-threaded approach!
